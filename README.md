# Employee Insights Dashboard

## Project Summary
This project presents an interactive Excel dashboard designed to analyze a company's workforce of 1,000 employees. By utilizing HR data, I developed this dashboard to help visualize trends in employee satisfaction, retention, and departmental distribution. It provides insights into crucial HR metrics, offering a data-driven approach to workforce management.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this dashboard were to:
1. **Analyze Employee Distribution:** Explore the gender ratio, department allocations, and job satisfaction ratings.
2. **Understand Retention Factors:** Identify factors impacting employee retention, such as distance from work and satisfaction levels.
3. **Evaluate Promotion and Service Trends:** Determine the rate of promotions and analyze employee tenure.

## Approach and Process
1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** 
   - Loaded the dataset and addressed inconsistencies to ensure clean, structured data for analysis.
   - Segmented employees by various attributes, including distance, department, and job satisfaction ratings.

2. **Dashboard Development in Excel:** 
   - Designed the layout with a mix of charts and metrics to present a visually appealing and informative view.
   - Utilized pivot tables and chart elements to enable dynamic exploration of metrics, like job satisfaction and retention.

3. **Insights Extraction:** 
   - Visualized the breakdown of gender distribution, satisfaction levels, and retention metrics.
   - Created interactive slicers for easy filtering by marital status, department, and job satisfaction ratings.

## Key Findings
- **Gender Distribution:** The workforce consists of 58% male and 42% female employees.
- **Satisfaction and Retention:** Employees with high job satisfaction showed a higher retention rate. 91% of the workforce is retained, while 9% have left.
- **Departmental Insights:** Research & Development holds the largest workforce, with Sales as the second-largest department.
- **Promotion Eligibility:** About 25% of employees are eligible for promotion, reflecting organizational growth potential.

## Reflection
Through this project, I enhanced my skills in data visualization within Excel and gained a deeper understanding of HR analytics. This experience sharpened my ability to create dashboards that are both functional and visually compelling, providing stakeholders with actionable insights into workforce dynamics.
